oh ok fine the case here is that we have a registration form and it says that we basically are committed for one month only and on this registration thing it says nothing about email so you you will not file by email that we have to call you to cancel and also we still not receive like email okay so we basically registration form that said that we are registered for one month and that now you charge a three month through our credit card and the what do you think we think this is reasonable
I was just calling about to see how much it would it cost to update the map in my car
